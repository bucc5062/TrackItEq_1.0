# TrackItEq_1.0
An android app that will allow equestrian riders the ability to create conditioning plans  
then run them as they ride to better help track time and pace.

In training a horse for a performance sport, they need to go through a conditioning program
that have a number of legs involved with different gaits and speeds.  This app, running on 
an android smartphone will allow the rider to create a variety of conditioning plans, as well
as edit or remove them.

Once the plan is built the rider can, when ready to start conditioning, select a plan from a list, 
have it loaded up so that when they tap play, the app will show three items of information to the 
rider as they go along.
1 - Pace average and current pace (speed)
2 - Remaining leg time and the gait that is requiered at the time
3 - Remaining total plan time

The gps locations are stored and and theend of a plan can be kept into a KLM file for display
on google earth maps (v2.0 may have it built into the app).
